### Packages Installation

First, make sure you have the necessary packages installed. You can do this with npm

npm install express body-parser cors -g

npm install @types/express @types/node typescript ts-node


#### Create a TypeScript configuration file

Make sure to set up a tsconfig.json

#### Creating the User Registration API

Make sure to create your TypeScript code, which, in my case, is the file call (User Registration API.ts)

### Running the Application

You can run the application using ts-node:

npx ts-node src/app.ts

Make sure to replace src/app.ts with the actual path of your TypeScript file if it's different.


### Explanation of the Code

Module Imports: import express, Request, and Response types for our app and body-parser to handle JSON body parsing.

Express Instance: create an instance of the Express application called app.

Middleware: use body-parser middleware to parse JSON requests, which allows us to access request bodies in a readable format.

User Interface: define a User interface that outlines the expected user data structure for type safety.

In-memory User Storage: create an array of users to store registered user information temporarily. In a production app, you would typically use a database.

POST Endpoint: define a /register endpoint that:

Destructures the user data from the request body.

Validate the input to ensure all fields are present.

Check if the email already exists in the user's array.

Creates a new user if validation passes and adds them to the user's array.

Responds with a success message and the user's data in JSON format.

Starting the Server: Finally, start the Express server on port 3000 and log a message indicating that the server is running.


This code provides a foundational structure for a REST API for user registration using TypeScript. As you develop further, consider integrating a database for user storage, adding authentication mechanisms, and implementing more.
