### Code

Restaurant.html This HTML file defines the structure of a webpage where the JavaScript output will be displayed

The script file contains JavaScript code that simulates a restaurant scenario.

It defines several variables to represent restaurant details, such as the total number of tables, table capacity, busy tables, and the number of waiting lists.


In summary, the HTML file sets up the webpage's structure. In contrast, the JavaScript file performs calculations and generates output dynamically to display the estimated wait times for tables in the waiting list. The combination of these files allows for a dynamic and interactive user experience related to restaurant waitlist calculations
